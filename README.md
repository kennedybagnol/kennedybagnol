ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kennedybagnol
I'm a recent Data Science bootcamp grad looking to make my way into the Data Science world.
Currently I'm working on refining my projects within my GitHub, they're still a work in progress! But I wanted to post these to show what I can do to anyone interested.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects! Since I'm relatively new to this field I welcome any challenges with open arms.
You can reach me on my linkedin! https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedybagnol/
